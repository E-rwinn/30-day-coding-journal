<h1>Day 1</h1>
<h3>What I did:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Started a Mini Quote Generator Project</li>
  <li>Styled the header section with CSS</li>
  <li>Laid down the basic layout for the project</li>
</ul>
<p>Today was the first day of my 30-day coding challenge. I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to build at first, so I decided to start small with a mini quote generator. I focused on getting the HTML structure set up and played around with styling the header using CSS ‚Äî trying out colors, fonts, and spacing to make it look clean and simple. It was a nice way to get back into coding without feeling overwhelmed. I‚Äôm excited to add more features like JavaScript later, but for now, just laying down the basics felt good and gave me some momentum to keep going.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Day 2</h1>
<h3>What I did:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Finished the quote generator project</li>
  <li>Fixed some HTML errors</li>
  <li>Started looking for ideas for my next mini project</li>
</ul>
<p>I started coding around 7 today and managed to wrap up the quote generator. Along the way, I spotted a few errors in my HTML that needed fixing, so I cleaned those up too. After finishing, I spent some time researching ideas for my next mini project. I‚Äôm thinking of doing something light that will help me get more experience with JavaScript and improve my skills. Feeling motivated to keep learning and building! :)</p>

  <li>Cleaned up my code a bit so it‚Äôs easier to understand later</li>
  <li>Balanced coding with studying by keeping it simple today</li>
</ul>
<p>
Had a busy day with studying and got home late, so I didn‚Äôt have much time to code. I kept it chill by finishing the joke generator ‚Äî something quick and fun that didn‚Äôt stress me out. Felt good to keep the streak going even on a hectic day.
