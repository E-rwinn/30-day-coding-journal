<p>Hmm, today was not as stressful as it usally is. I began by creating a new repo for my project that i would be doing tommorow, i noticed there was an issue in my readME so i decided to fix it aswell as adding my <strong>new</strong> portfolio website, yay! while doing that i got the idea to challenge my self to do a recipe page from scratch, but i plan on doing that later on when i have more freetime since that would possibly take more than 1 day, but yea that what i did for today :}.</p>
